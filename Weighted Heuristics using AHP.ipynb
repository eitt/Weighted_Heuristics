    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a multi-criteria decision-making methodology developed by Thomas L. Saaty in the 1970s. It provides a structured framework for decomposing a complex decision-making problem into a hierarchy of smaller, easier-to-compare parts. The method uses pairwise comparisons and eigenvalue methods to determine the importance of each criterion and alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Foundations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hierarchy Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical AHP model consists of three main levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Objective**: The goal of the decision-making problem.\n",
    "2. **Criteria**: The different dimensions or aspects to be considered for achieving the objective.\n",
    "3. **Alternatives**: The various choices or options to be evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pairwise Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "AHP employs pairwise comparisons to capture the decision-maker's subjective judgments about the relative importance of criteria or alternatives. Usually, Saaty's scale (1-9) is used to facilitate these comparisons. This scale helps decision-makers quantify their judgments and make more informed decisions based on the relative importance of the different criteria or alternatives being considered. The scale is structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1: Equal importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3: Moderate importance of one over another.\n",
    "\n",
    "5: Strong importance of one over another.\n",
    "\n",
    "7: Demonstrated the importance of one over another.\n",
    "\n",
    "9: Absolute importance of one over another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, intermediate values (2, 4, 6, 8) can be used for more nuanced comparisons. For instance, a value of 2 might be used when the items are slightly more important than each other but not moderately more important. In this example, we only consider non-even values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective Representation of Subjective Judgements\n",
    "\n",
    "Saaty's scale provides a way to convert qualitative judgments into quantifiable data. The quantification enables decision-makers to translate \"eXperience\" into a \"rule\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Consistency in Decision-Making\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a standardized scale provides a consistent methodology across different decision-making scenarios. The standardization allows for better comparison between criteria and alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Facilitates Complex Comparisons\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with multiple criteria, each with varying levels of importance, Saaty's scale helps break down complex judgments into pairwise comparisons, simplifying the decision-making process and giving weight to the most important criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Enables Prioritization\n",
    "\n",
    "Once numerical values are assigned, they derive weighted averages, which help prioritize different factors or alternatives. The assignation is particularly important in resource allocation or strategy setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Facilitates Collaborative Decision-Making\n",
    "\n",
    "In group settings, Saaty's scale allows multiple stakeholders to articulate their preferences or judgments in a quantifiable manner, making it easier to arrive at a consensus.\n",
